# Reading 2

Reading 2 is about ethics, and specifically the ethical issues that arise when working with large amounts of data. In class we talk more about the topic and theory of ethics, with some practical examples. These readings go into much more detail about practical applications for ethics in data science, and how you may want to tackle such challenges, and why they exist. Patil's article has a lot of good practical tips to think about when writing your ethics section in Assignment 1 and the final. Narayanan's paper provides a close look into the issues surrounding personal data the dangerous inherit when working with and storing such data.

### Deon Checklist Tool

Deon <a href="https://deon.drivendata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view &#x2197;</a> is a command line tool that allows you to easily add an ethics checklist to your data science projects. You can look at this checklist for an example during the ethics portion of assignment 1 and your final group project.

The HIPAA privacy rule sets forth policies to protect all individually identifiable health information that is held or transmitted. These are the 18 HIPAA Identifiers that are considered personally identifiable information. This information can be used to identify, contact, or locate a single person or can be used with other sources to identify a single individual. When personally identifiable information is used in conjunction with one’s physical or mental health or condition, health care, or one’s payment for that health care, it becomes Protected Health Information (PHI).

If a communication contains any of these identifiers, or parts of the identifier, such as initials, the data is to be considered “identified”.   To be considered “de-identified”, ALL of the 18 HIPAA Identifiers must be removed from the data set.  This includes all dates, such as surgery dates, all voice recordings, and all photographic images.
