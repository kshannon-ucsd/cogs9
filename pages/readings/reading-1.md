# Reading 1

- Donoho D, 50 Years of Data Science <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ucsd.cogs9/readings/r1-Donoho-2017-50-Years-of-Data-Science.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download &#x2197;</a>

How does it fit in with statistics and computer science? If it is an actual academic field, how does one perform and study data science?
