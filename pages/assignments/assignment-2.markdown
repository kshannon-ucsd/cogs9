<h2>Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ</h2>

1. How many parameters are required to find the p-values?
>You can choose whatever combination you have as long as the p-value is less than 0.05. Just make sure that you write down the parameters sufficiently clearly, so your results can be easily replicated.
1. How much detail do we need to go into for the justification when picking our first set of variables?
>Not much, as this is not a poli sci course. There just needs to be some justification for what you selected. This may be a bit challenging, especially if you have less knowledge of US politics and the economy. We understand this and for this reason your justification does not need to be true, and we do not need to agree with the justification. But try to make it as logical as possible to support your hypothesis.
