<h1>Exam or a Lack Thereof</h1>

{: .important }
There is **NO final exam in class** during finals week. The final exam has been replaced by a more **comprehensive group project**... No final?! ðŸ¥³ though maybe some of you are more like ðŸ¤¬ or maybe ðŸ˜­, perhaps you think I am a ðŸ‘» or trolling you. I am not. Group work and communication is a cornerstone of data science projetcs. I wish for you all to have as many group work experiences as you can while at UCSD.
