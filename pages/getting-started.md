# Getting Started

1. Join the class Discord: **{{ variables.discord_link }}**
   - Use Discord to ask questions and get help from your fellow students, TAs, IAs, and myself
   - In-class polls (instead of iclickers) are done through Discord, as well as for in-class discussions
2. Register for the class Gradescope
   -  Gradescope link: **{{ variables.gradescope_link }}**
   -  Entry code: **{{ variables.gradescope_entry_code }}**
   -  When registering for **Gradescope** you must include your **Student ID/PID** and **UCSD Email**.
3. Start Reading 1, it is a very long reading, the longest by far!
4. Make sure you attend the discussion sections during week 2 or 3, we will be forming project groups
5. Stop by one of the office hours or come up to the front of the class before or after to say hi and introduce yourself! I'd love to meet and get to know you.
