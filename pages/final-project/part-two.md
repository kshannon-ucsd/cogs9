<h1>Final Part 2</h1>

- Final Project part 2 Google Doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHDgAL1KwrPn9W8KopT9pCOCJWJOlO7Ibh-45tCoJe0/edit?usp=drivesdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view &#x2197;</a>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

You can access the Final Project template (link above). Make a copy of this document and give edit rights to all members of the group. The first five sections of this document are the same as the first part. You should copy and paste your first part into this document, replacing the pertinent sections. Be sure to incorporate feedback from the instructional staff you received on A1 and update anywhere with information you learned in the second half of the course to improve these sections. It is OK if these sections remain largely the same as what you submitted for A1 if you believe they are solid and good to go. But now that we have learned quite a bit since A1 was due. And we will be looking for cleaner text and clear logic. E.g. you may need to tighten up your data science question in order to do an analysis.

{: .note }
You are allowed to completely change your original project from part 1, if as a group you decide you want to go in another direction. You do not have to get approval to do so. 

After editing the first five sections of your project, you will replace "ADD YOUR GROUP‚ÄôS TEXT HERE AND DELETE INSTRUCTIONS ABOVE" with your group‚Äôs response for the remaining sections and delete the grey instructions for the following sections:
- Analysis Proposal
- Discussion
- Group Participation

For these additional sections, read the instructions provided on your document for each section. Replace the instructions within each section with your group‚Äôs project information. When complete, **save the document as a PDF and submit on Gradescope**. Be sure to add all group members to the submission on Gradescope. Note! You (individually, not the group) can‚Äôt receive a passing score on this final if you don‚Äôt contribute. **Please make sure everyone on your team has responsibility. If you do not contribute anything‚Ä¶**

*You shall not pass...*

{: .warning }
There are no late submissions accepted, unless there is an issue outside of your control. If so, email your course instructors and all your teammates. Before the due date.
